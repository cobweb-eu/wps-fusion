# WPS offering spatial data fusion processes

fusion branch for 52n WPS

Description taken from https://github.com/52North/WPS:

The 52°North Web Processing Service (WPS) enables the deployment of geo-processes on the web in
a standardized way. It features a pluggable architecture for processes and data encodings.
The implementation is based on the current OpenGIS specification: 05-007r7.

Its focus was the creation of an extensible framework to provide algorithms for generalization on the web.
